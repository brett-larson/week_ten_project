    Description:
        This Python file represents the credit card processing vendor that the credit card app
        server calls to receive an approval or declined message. In this case, approval is based
        on the amount of the purchase.

        This code is based on the week four assignment with additional modifications to integrate
        with the new program features and functionality.
